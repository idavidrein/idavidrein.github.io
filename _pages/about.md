I'm a researcher at [METR](https://metr.org), making [benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17354), [measuring the impacts](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) of AI tools on software developer productivity, and [modeling trends](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) in AI capabilities.

I'm most well-known for creating [GPQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12022), one of the (as of mid-2025) most widely used AI capability benchmarks. I've also done [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08702) on scalable oversight (i.e. trying to figure out how to supervise a system that's smarter or more capable than the supervisor), and I was one of the first few employees at [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), where I trained embedding models for semantic search.
